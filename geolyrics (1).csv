Say, I've been tryna live
I've been tryna focus
But nobody know us
Gave me love at no cost
Say the rest na bonus, uhn
What you do me no normal
I've been thinking of someone
Can't say ""Baby, what's up"" now
Shey before I see you, o do la, hmm

Like igbo na ganja, uhn, uhn
Like shayo na bastard, uhn, uhn
Like cigar na cancer
Olosho na person daughter
All the things you do me I gun down
When den thief catch olopa, eh
Say natural disaster
What I got and what I ordered

I remember when I saw you last time
You said that was the last time
Until I saw you last night
And then we had a nice time, uhn
Baby girl, it's high time
I have to know my crime
Would you let me use a lifeline?
'Cause these feeling's for a lifetime, yeah

Don't ruin my happiness
You're the one who's starting this
How I feel about my feelings is my business not yours
But you're bad like your friend
That's why you both move together
I go swear I got you to the end
I swear I'll be your umbrella
I don't wanna get hold by the neck
With my little few, I'm blessed
I don't wanna be by myself
'Cause I'm a mess without you

Like igbo na ganja, uhn, uhn
Like shayo na bastard, uhn, uhn

Would you let me use a lifeline?
'Cause these feeling's for a lifetime, yeah

If no be God, if no be for Jesu
You see all I get thank you for mercy
That satan wan give me hypertension
But my money don go jollificate
Huh, I need something to break up this spinning wheel
I'm not getting head but dancing in the wind
I just hope I see you once again
I just hope I see you well again

Had no money in my pocket with nobody to call
I was shooting for the stars and was hoping they fall
I was waiting on the sunlight
Tryna get this one right
Had to get my funds right

Sometimes I'm happy Sometimes I'm sad
I don't know what's over me
Sometimes I'm good sometimes I'm wild
I don't know what's over me

I don't know what's over me
I'm over thinking everything
At times it feels like nobody
Can understand the way I feel
Cause I'm fucked up totally

I don't know how to keep company
So I've been drinking cognac

I've been drinking too many shots of cognac

One for the belly another for the broken heart
Three for addiction four so I don't go back
Looking for somebody wey fit watch my shoulders
So, I can never be sober

I can never be sooo soo uhh uhh
(I can never be sooo)
Ohh ohh
Yes I did it
How many million I make for a living

Wear my Louis Vuitton
Post for a pic
Let the camera light hit my teeth
You know

Nobody is better than me
Nobody is better than me
I do it differently
Everybody can see

But I don't know what's over me
I'm over thinking everything
At times it feels like nobody
Can understand the way I feel
Cause I am fucked up totally

I don't know how to keep company
So I've been drinking cognac
I've been drinking too many shots of cognac

One for the belly another for the broken heart

Looking for somebody wey fit watch my shoulders
